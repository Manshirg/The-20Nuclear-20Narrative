              The transformation of public perception toward nuclear science represents one of the most dramatic shifts 
              in American attitudes toward technology and government authority. What began as scientific wonder and 
              national pride evolved through calculated propaganda efforts to ultimately become widespread skepticism and activism.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Each era reflects not only changing scientific understanding but also evolving relationships between 
              citizens, government, and technological power. The shift from optimism to fear to organized resistance 
              demonstrates how lived experience, media representation, and government transparency shape public trust 
              in complex technologies.
